## Introduction

In this repository, I share my journey of learning C++ programming. As a developer familiar with the MERN stack and Java, I'm expanding my skills to include C++ for its performance and versatility. This repository serves as a log of my progress, code snippets, and resources I find helpful along the way.

## Getting Started

If you're new to C++ or want to follow along with my learning journey, you can start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cplusplus-learning.git
```

Then, dive into the code, explore the files, and feel free to experiment with them on your own.

## Topics Covered

Throughout my learning journey, I'll be covering a variety of topics in C++, including but not limited to:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow structures
- Functions and classes
- Pointers and memory management
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Advanced topics like templates and exceptions

## Resources

Here are some resources I find useful for learning C++:

- [C++ documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- Books:
  - "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo
  - "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers
- Online tutorials and courses:
  - [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
  - [Coursera C++ courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=c%2B%2B)

Feel free to suggest additional resources that you find helpful!

## Progress

I'll be updating my progress regularly in this section. Check back often to see how far I've come in my C++ learning journey.

### Day 1: Introduction to C++
- Reviewed basic syntax and data types
- Wrote my first "Hello, World!" program
- Explored control flow structures like if, else, and loops

### Day 2: Functions and Classes
- Learned about function declarations and definitions
- Created custom classes and instantiated objects
- Explored class constructors and member functions

(Continue updating your progress daily or as frequently as you'd like)
